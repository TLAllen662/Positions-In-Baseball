    <h1>The Battery</h1>
    <p>- The Battery in baseball is a combination of the two players who touch the ball the most, the pitcher and catcher.</p>
    <h2>Pitcher</h2>
    <p>- The pitcher is the one player who is guaranteed to be involved in every single play that occurs. The pitcher is the player who "pitches" the baseball to the hitter every play. The objective of the pitcher is to get the batter out. This can come in multiple ways. These can include by striking out the batter, which occurs when there are three strikes thrown before the hitter hits the ball or by the batter hitting the ball and being forced out by one of the fielders.</p>
    <h2>Catcher</h2>
    <p>- The catcher is the person on the field who sets up behind home plate and catches the pitches that the pitcher throws. Catchers where specific gear to protect themselves from injury while the pitcher throws the ball at him every single play. This gear is called catcher's gear. The catcher alsop wheres a specific kind of glove that has more padding than the typical glove to protect their hands. The catcher is the one who relays to the pitcher what pitch is needed to be thrown and is the second most involved player on the field.</p>
    <h1>The Infielders</h1>
    <p>- The infielders are the ones who man position themselves near the bases on the infield of the field. There are four infielders; First Baseman, Second Baseman, Shortstop, and Third Baseman.</p>
    <h2>First Baseman</h2>
    <p>- A first baseman is a player in baseball who stands near first base and plays an important role in getting batters out. Their main job is to catch throws from other players, especially the pitcher or the shortstop, to tag out the batter who is trying to reach first base. When a batter hits the ball, the first baseman needs to be ready to either catch the ball if it’s thrown to them or be ready to tag the runner before they reach the base. They also help in stopping ground balls or catching high throws and making quick plays to get outs. So, to sum it up: the first baseman is like a big target at first base, ready to catch the ball and make sure no one gets to stand on that base!</p>
    <h2>Second Baseman</h2>
    <p>- A second baseman is a player in baseball who stands near second base, between first and third base. They’re responsible for covering the area around second base and often play a key role in turning double plays—when the team gets two outs in one play. When the ball is hit, the second baseman helps field ground balls that come toward them and tries to get the ball to first base for an out. But their main job is to receive throws from the shortstop or the first baseman and either tag the runner going to second base or just touch the base to get the out. So, think of the second baseman like the bridge between the first and third baseman, always moving around to help get outs and keep the game going!</p>
    <h2>Shortstop</h2>
    <p>- A shortstop is the player who stands between second and third base. They cover a lot of ground and are often considered one of the most important and athletic players on the field because they have to react quickly to balls hit in all directions. Their main job is to field ground balls that come their way, especially those hit between second and third base, and then throw the ball to first base to get the batter out. They also play a big role in turning double plays by receiving throws from the second baseman and quickly tossing the ball to first base or even tagging a runner out themselves. Shortstops need to have great reflexes, good hands, and be fast because they’re often involved in critical plays. They’re basically the “captain” of the infield, helping organize the defense and making quick, smart decisions to stop runs from scoring.</p>
    <h2>Third Baseman</h2>
    <p>- A third baseman is the player who stands next to third base, on the far right side of the infield. They’re positioned to field any balls hit toward the left side of the field, especially hard-hit grounders or line drives. The third baseman’s main job is to catch these balls and either throw them to first base for an out or tag the runner heading to third base. They're also the ones who usually have to react quickly to fast-hit balls that come at them, so they need to have quick reflexes and a strong arm. Third basemen often have the nickname “the hot corner” because that part of the field gets a lot of fast, hard hits—like a "hot" spot in the game! They’re crucial in preventing runs from scoring, and they often have to make really precise, quick throws to get outs.</p>
